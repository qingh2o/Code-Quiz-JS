# Code-Quiz-JS
Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description 

This Code-Quiz-JS was created for bootcamp students who were taking the sixth week's challenge. In this challenge, my task was to create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:
The password generator application must meet the following critical requirements:
* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears. 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock
* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
